		<h3>Inside Google Dublin (EU HQ)</h3>

			<p>The Irish equivalent of Silicon Valley finds it’s home in Dublin’s booming tech quarter, Silicon Docks. <br>
			Dublin is one of our major regional Sales offices, with teams helping businesses of all sizes reach their market goals.<br>
			 On the tech side, Site Reliability Engineers and Network Operations teams help ensure that we deliver a fast, efficient,<br>
			 and powerful web to customers around the world, whenever they need it.<br><br>

			We’re proud of the role we’ve played in revitalizing the neighborhood, and the impact we’ve had on the city.<br>
			 The area has become a hub of Ireland’s emergent technology scene, bursting with start-ups as well as the European headquarters <br>
			 for some of the biggest tech companies in the world. We designed our offices to celebrate the city, with everything from music <br>
			 rooms to a kitchen disguised as a traditional Irish pub. Throughout our buildings, we have five cafes and 40 micro kitchens.<br>
			 Each of our floors has a different Google-themed motif, like “Search” and “App-iness,” and hundreds of meetings rooms that imagine<br>
			 aspects of Irish, tech, or green culture.<br><br>

			As Google’s center for sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we work with a broad range of businesses and markets.<br>
			 Small businesses—as well as multinationals—from more than 50 countries in the region, rely on products like Chrome, Search, Maps, AdWords, Apps, and more.<br>

			Whether it’s because of our diversity, our passion for what we do, or our location in the heart of one of the world’s friendliest,<br>
			 most charming cities, the work that we do here is great craic.</p>
